# Unnamed 2D RPG - Unity Game Development Project

## Introduction

This repository contains my first major Unity project - an unnamed 2D RPG that I started in 2020. The main purpose of this project was to learn about various aspects of game development, including C# programming, game mechanics implementation, and the overall game development process.

## Project Overview

At its core, this 2D RPG served as a learning platform where I explored different game mechanics such as crafting, quests, and combat. Initially, I envisioned a sandbox RPG set in prehistoric times, where players would expand their territory by defeating enemy tribes, gather resources, and progress through quests to unlock new technologies. However, as the project evolved, I decided to adjust my goals and focus on honing my skills while exploring and implementing a wide range of features.

## Key Learning Objectives

Throughout the development process, I aimed to achieve the following learning objectives:

- **C# Programming**: I used this project as an opportunity to delve into C# programming, understanding its syntax, data structures, and object-oriented principles.

- **Project Scope Management**: As the project grew in ambition, I learned the importance of managing scope and making realistic decisions about the features to include.

- **Hands-on Experience**: By working on this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in game development and sharpened my problem-solving skills.

## Project Status

As of now, the project remains in its original state, serving as a testament to my growth as a developer. While I initially aspired to release this game to the public, I found more value in using it as a stepping stone for personal learning and development.
